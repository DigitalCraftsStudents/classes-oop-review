# Intro to the `class` syntax (Object-Oriented Programming)

- 

## What is `this`?

It's the "owner" of a function. 

Most of the time, it's the "caller" of the function. 

Alternatively, you can set it by using:

- an arrow function (The value of `this` inside an arrow function cannot be changed)
- the `.bind()` function (You can manually pass in the value of `this`.)

## Prototypes

Under the hood, classes are just nicer syntax for prototype functions.

## Libraries used

- [readline-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-promise) - to get user input from the command line.
